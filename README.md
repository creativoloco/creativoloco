# Hi there! 👋

## About Me
I'm 🧔🏻‍♂️ Diego López, also known as CreativoLoco 🤪. Before starting in this wonderful world of programming, I worked as a graphic designer for 10 years, making all kinds of designs. I always enjoyed designing websites, so I decided to focus on graphic design for applications.

I've used ***Javascript*** as main language to build
- *Adobe Extend Script plugins* for Illustrator, Indesign, Photoshop and After Effects ( these are Adobe Creative Suite Applications )
- *Mobile applications* using NativeScript
- *Desktop Applications* using ElectronJS, Angular and Typescript
- *Fronted Web Applications* using mostly React framework, but also Angular2+
- *Backend Web Applications* using Mongoose, Express, NodeJS, NGNX, MongoDB and pug
- *Console Applications* using nodeJS.

I declare myself in love with using 💙 ***Typescript*** 💙


## About the future...
I am enthusiastic about **Quantum Programming**. In my free time I study this topic to one day be able to master it.


- 👀 I’m interested in Remote Job
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ because I want to understand how Javascript works depply behind the scene.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Adobe Extend Script Scripts
